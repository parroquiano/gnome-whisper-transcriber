## Troubleshooting

### Checking Requirements

Make sure ffmpeg and curl are installed:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg curl

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg curl
```

### Verify /tmp Access

Both ffmpeg and curl must have write access to the /tmp directory:

```bash
# Test ffmpeg write access
ffmpeg -f alsa -i default -t 1 /tmp/test.ogg

# Test curl write access
curl -s https://example.com -o /tmp/test.txt
```

### Debug Logs

Check the GNOME Shell logs for errors:

```bash
journalctl -f /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep "Whisper Transcriber"
```

### Common Issues

1. **Extension doesn't appear in panel**: Make sure the extension is enabled and the schema is properly compiled.

2. **Recording doesn't work**: Check if ffmpeg is installed and can access your microphone.

3. **Transcription fails**: Verify your API key is correct and has access to the Whisper API.

4. **UI freezes**: The extension should use asynchronous processing, but if you encounter UI freezes, please report the issue.
